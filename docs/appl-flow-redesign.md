# Application Flow Redesign

## Objective

The objective is to make each form user friendly and familiar on the way of working. We need to redesign the flow, prioritizing the use of the application in mobile devices.

## Header

- We need a header common to all view that always remains in place.
- The language selector needs to be on the top right side of the header.
- Below the title on the left we need a home button that goes to the list view. When the page is refreshed we always go to home.

## List view

- In list view you click on a record or you can create a new record.
- When you click on a record it opens in summary view.

## Summary view

- Please use the latest design to make the summary view, look modern and sleek.
- The idea is to have tabs, buttons, cerds or whatever is best according to web design best practices.
- From the summary you can edit the record, which would be equivalent to going to the form view.
- You can also go to the follow-up view, which is the view that shows the follow-up actions that can be taken after the record is submitted.
- You can create a new record which will be a copy of the record you are viewing.
- No need to display the Record ID, this is too technical for the user.
- When in context of a record you can easily navigate between the form view, the summary view and the follow-up view.

## Form view

- It this the current view is good.

## Follow-up view

- It this the current view is good.
