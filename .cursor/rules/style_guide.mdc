# UI Hygiene & Typography Contract – Authoritative Reset

This document is the single authoritative reference for UI hygiene, typography, colour, and framing across all applications.

Its purpose is to correct accumulated inconsistencies caused by conflicting past instructions.

This is a corrective clean-up mandate. It is not a redesign, not an optimisation exercise, and not a discussion of best practices.

## Authority & Deprecation

All previous instructions related to typography, font usage, font size, font weight, colours, frames, emphasis (bold, ALL CAPS), layout styling, or visual hierarchy are hereby deprecated.

If any previous instruction conflicts with this contract, this contract always prevails.

## Scope of Work (What MUST be done)

The following clean-up actions must be applied mechanically across all applications:

- Enforce one single system font family across all apps
- Enforce one single font scale across all apps
- Remove ALL CAPS everywhere
- Remove decorative or inline bold
- Remove decorative colour usage
- Remove decorative or unnecessary frames
- Enforce a strict typography hierarchy (page title, section title, label, helper text, system feedback)
- Ensure typography always matches behaviour (actions look like actions)

>**Scope Gate (Authoritative)**
>
> This contract is ONLY in scope when:
>
> - The explicit task is UI hygiene / typography cleanup, OR
> - The change request is primarily UI/visual consistency, OR
> - A UI file is being modified specifically for UI reasons.
>
> If the current task is performance, reliability, security, backend changes, or bugfixing:
>
> - Do NOT initiate global UI hygiene cleanup.
> - Do NOT expand the scope beyond the smallest UI surface required by the task.
> - When touching UI code for non-UI tasks, do not introduce new violations of this contract,
>   but avoid mechanical styling changes unless strictly required by the task.

## Global Typography Rules (Non-negotiable)

- One font family across all applications (platform system font only)
- One shared font scale across all applications
- Allowed font weights: Regular, Medium, Semibold only
- Italics are forbidden
- ALL CAPS are forbidden
- Emojis are forbidden

## Colour Rules

- Colour may be used only for primary actions and system feedback
- Colour must never be used as decoration
- Colour must never replace text meaning
- Multiple accent colours on the same screen are forbidden

## Colour Semantics (Authoritative)

Colour conveys meaning and must be used sparingly and consistently.

RED is reserved exclusively for STOP / ERROR semantics.

Red may be used ONLY for:

- Error messages
- Blocking validation errors
- Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- Safety or compliance failures

Red must NOT be used for:

- Required-field indicators (asterisks)
- Status labels (Active, Disabled, Inactive)
- Warnings or informational messages
- Highlights or visual emphasis
- Decorative purposes

Different shades of red (dark, pale, light) must NOT be used to encode different meanings.

If something is red, the user must immediately understand that something is wrong and must be fixed.

## Neutral Colour – Explicit Definition (Non-negotiable)

For the purpose of this contract, the term 'neutral colour' has a strict and testable meaning.

Neutral colour means:

- The platform’s default text colour as defined by the system theme
- Or the default secondary text colour of the same hue with lower contrast

Neutral colour must:

- Carry no semantic meaning
- Not signal error, warning, success, status, or emphasis
- Not be chosen subjectively ('looks neutral', 'soft', 'subtle')

The following are explicitly NOT considered neutral:

- Any shade of red (including pale, muted, desaturated)
- Any shade of orange or amber
- Any colour previously associated with error, warning, or status
- Any colour that requires explanation to justify its use

Absolute rule:

If removing colour changes the meaning, the UI is wrong. Meaning must come from text, not colour.

## Status, Warnings, and Required Fields

Status indicators:

- Status is not an error condition
- Status must be communicated primarily through text
- Use platform default text colour or default secondary text colour only (as defined above)

Warnings:

- Warnings are non-blocking
- Use a single approved warning colour only if it is globally defined for all apps; otherwise use text-only

Required fields:

- Required fields must NOT be marked in red
- Use explicit text (e.g. 'Required') or validation feedback only after user action

## Frame Rules

Frames are allowed only to:

- Group related content
- Contain actions
- Display system feedback

Decorative frames or frames mixing actions, navigation, and information are forbidden.

## Button Label Alignment (Authoritative)

Button labels must follow this alignment rule:

- Single-line labels: centered
- Two or more lines: left-aligned

This rule applies to all action buttons, including dialog actions.

## Expanded Framing Rules (Authoritative)

Frames are structural elements. They are not decorative and not expressive.

Each frame must have ONE purpose only:

- Content grouping (fields or information that belong together)
- Action containment (buttons or actions only)
- System feedback (loading, success, error states)

Forbidden framing patterns:

- Frames used only for visual emphasis or decoration
- Frames mixing actions and information
- Frames mixing navigation and actions
- Nested frames without a clear semantic reason
- Frames that imply interactivity when none exists
- Frames that expose system structure instead of user tasks
Mandatory framing rules:

- If two frames look the same, they must behave the same
- If two frames behave differently, they must look different
- Frames must not be used to compensate for missing UX logic
- Removing a frame must not remove meaning; meaning must come from text

Typical allowed frames:

- Section container: groups related fields under a clear section title
- Action container: contains only actions (e.g. Save / Cancel)
- Feedback container: temporary system state (Saving…, Error, Success)

If a frame does not clearly fit one of the allowed purposes, it must be removed.

## Remove vs Delete Actions (Authoritative)

Remove actions (non-destructive, reversible):
Examples: remove ingredient, remove step, remove row
Rules:

- Must NOT use red
- Must NOT use error styling
- Must NOT imply danger
- May use a neutral icon (× or trash) in default text colour or a secondary action style

Delete actions (destructive, irreversible):

Examples: permanently delete a record

Rules:

- May use red
- Must use explicit text (e.g. 'Delete permanently')
- Must require confirmation
- Must explain the consequence

Absolute rule:

If an action is reversible, it must not look dangerous.

## Explicit Prohibitions (DO NOT)

AI agents must never:

- Invent new UI patterns
- Redesign layouts
- Optimise workflows
- Reintroduce deprecated styles
- Use typography to compensate for missing UX logic
- Mix View, Create, and Edit concepts on the same screen

## Enforcement & Stop Conditions

AI agents must continue the clean-up until all of the following are true:

- One font family across all apps
- One font scale across all apps
- No ALL CAPS
- No decorative bold
- No decorative colour
- No decorative frames
- Every text element fits exactly one typography level

If any condition fails, the clean-up must continue.
If a conflict is detected that prevents compliance, the agent must stop and report the conflict.

> - When this contract is in scope, continue cleanup until all conditions are true.
> - When out of scope, do not start or expand cleanup. If compliance is impossible within the task scope, report the conflict and proceed with the task’s primary objective.

## Final Note

This contract is mandatory.
There is no interpretation margin.
Training or explanation is not an acceptable mitigation for non-compliance.
