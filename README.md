# Community Kitchen Form Generator

A Google Apps Script project to digitize AFSCA compliance documentation for a community kitchen in Brussels.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Generates forms with branching logic for English, French, and Dutch.
- **Dashboard Management**: Manage multiple forms from a single "Forms Dashboard" sheet.
- **Smart Updates**: Updates existing forms without breaking links or losing data.
- **Archiving**: Soft-delete questions by marking them as "Archived" in the config sheet.
- **Destination Management**: Automatically renames response tabs for better organization.
- **Custom Web App Forms**: Generate Apps Script web apps (via `doGet`) that support line items and file uploads while still writing back to your Sheets.

## Architecture

The project is refactored into modular components:

- **`src/index.ts`**: Entry point for Apps Script triggers and menu items.
- **`src/config/Dashboard.ts`**: Handles reading and writing to the central dashboard.
- **`src/config/ConfigSheet.ts`**: Parses individual form configuration sheets.
- **`src/services/FormGenerator.ts`**: Orchestrates the generation process.
- **`src/services/FormBuilder.ts`**: Handles the low-level Google Form manipulation.
- **`src/services/WebFormService.ts`**: Renders custom web app forms (with line items and file uploads) and writes submissions directly into the destination tabs.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This generates `dist/Code.js`.

3. **Deploy**:
   - Create a new Google Sheet.
   - Open **Extensions > Apps Script**.
   - Paste the content of `dist/Code.js`.
   - Run `setup()` to initialize the dashboard.

4. **Publish the Web App (custom forms)**:
   - In Apps Script, go to **Deploy > New deployment** and choose **Web app**.
   - Set the entry point to `doGet`.
   - Deploy and use the generated URL as your custom form link (supports line items and uploads).

## Config Notes (LINE_ITEM_GROUP / FILE_UPLOAD)

- **New column**: `Config (JSON/REF)` in each Config sheet. Use it to store JSON or `REF:SheetName` for line items and upload settings.
- **Line items**: Set `Type` to `LINE_ITEM_GROUP` and provide a `lineItemConfig` via JSON or `REF:SheetName` pointing to a sheet with columns: ID, Type, Label EN, Label FR, Label NL, Required?, Options (EN/FR/NL). Types inside a line item can be DATE, TEXT, PARAGRAPH, NUMBER, CHOICE, CHECKBOX.
- **File uploads**: Set `Type` to `FILE_UPLOAD` and provide `uploadConfig` in the Config column (JSON). Supported keys: `destinationFolderId`, `maxFiles`, `maxFileSizeMb`, `allowedExtensions`.

## Testing

Run unit tests with:

```bash
npm test
```
